    <Info Key="boat" NextKey="welcome">The boat ride to Port Kaituma was filled with plenty of turbulence and rough seas.

    <Info Key="welcome" NextKey="escape1">Upon arriving in Jonestown, passing under the sign reading "Peoples Temple Agricultural Project", you are faced with the reality that it might not be the paradise that you were so proudly promised.

Though you are able to leave undetected, you are disoriented in the never-endign wilderness, and quickly find yourself hungry and dehydrated. When your absence is noticed in the morning, a search party of Temple security guards is sent out to find you. Having been unable to venture far from the edge of camp, you are quickly discovered by the guards, and forcibly confined in the settlement. You're told that you will never be allowed to leave the infirmary unguarded, and it will be impossible for you to try to defect again.</GameOver>

The other temple members are shocked, and enthusiastically defend the Temple's reputation, asking you why are exaggerating everything, and why you didn't just bring up your concerns with Temple leadership in Jonestown. From their expertly worded questions, it is clear that they were trained and prepared for this exact moment. The consul says that you can book a meeting the following day to discuss your concerns further, but you know that there's nowhere safe for you to go in the meantime.
